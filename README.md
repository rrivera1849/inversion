Quick Description of RL-Based Alg.

1. At every instance, we're deciding whether or not we should merge two chunks.
2. We have ways to measure the distance between the two chunks, namely semantic distances and various measures of stylistic similarity, and perhaps even PPL and others.
3. We want some approximation of the global changepoints with all the
